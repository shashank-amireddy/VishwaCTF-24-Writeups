He gave me some instructions related to it:

1)He told me he saw some names in call logs those are:
        Felix Delastelle, Dmitri Mendeleev

2)He also gave me 2 matrices A and B and told to perform same operation on matrix A and B as of performed on matrix P and Q. Find something related to biochemistry to crack my phone password.
  Matrix A =    45 35 93 95 24 65
                25 15 55 64 36 45
                15 65 62 16 65 38
                19 64 35 69 65 63
                47 67 48 60 39 27
                66 48 77 22 10 69

Matrix B =      33 25 30 11 68 65
                83 36 19 33 55 51
                20 16 48 63 41 71
                30 42 12 25 31 37

Matrix Q=       50 52 36
                90 75 28
                80 9  18

Result Matrix of P and Q =              60   82   36
                                        60   109  104
