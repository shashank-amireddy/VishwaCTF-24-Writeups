BitBane encryption is done by encoding then they have applied a key and then the extraSecurity.
we can get the flag by directly reversing those steps.
coming from back step 3 is easy as if idx = i+2 integers in vectors are simple bitwise NOTed
                 step 2 we know the key (VishwaCTF) and it is used to XOR, so send the encrypted text to the same function we can get the decrypted content
                 step 1 this was the hardest part and brute force is the only way i found we should search in all charecters for every integer in the vector
